It's been a long time since I have worked directly from importing a file in JS, so I am unsure what is going wrong but despite streaming correctly at first, any time I try to work with the data from the file everything is getting converted to unicode characters e.g. ``\x00"\x002\x000\x001\x000\x00-\x001\x000\x00-\x001\x000\x00"\x00\t\x003\x000\x00\t\x000\x00\t\x000\x00\t\x000\x00\t\x000\x00',``

Because of this roadblock I have been unable to get the chart working correctly, but I did go ahead and set up the page to work as a server-side page, and added the ability to filter the data based on clicking the date buttons. This data filtering is also not working totally correctly, as the date to compare is being formatted with unicode characters once I try to work with it.

Given the time constraint for doing this as a take-home challenge, I'm uploading this as-is for now with what I have completed so far.
